Note in advance that this may include more things than strictly nescesary for whatever you're doing, but includes the things for all the things you could be doing.

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo apt install ubuntu-drivers-common
sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
sudo reboot

do what this says:
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-90-download-archive?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&target_distro=Ubuntu&target_version=1604&target_type=deblocal>
Note the .deb file you download for CUDA has to be renamed from -deb to .deb for some reason (mv name1 name2), and that you have to add the key it tells you to


sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit

Go here:
https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download
Download CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7.0.5 for the current release of TensorFlow (it's in the archived versions list), both the run time and the developer version. Note that you can't wget either to a server to crazy DRM restrictions.
Install both by running sudo dpkg -i <fileName>, starting with the runtime.


Other things you may want to run:
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip
sudo pip3 install tensorflow-gpu
sudo pip3 install keras
sudo pip3 install opencv-python
sudo pip3 install pandas
sudo pip3 install scikit-image
sudo pip3 install scikit-learn
